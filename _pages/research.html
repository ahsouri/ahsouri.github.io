				<p>Advancements in satellite remote-sensing of <strong>formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) </strong>compounds have encouraged many to utilize columnar <strong>HCHO/NO<sub>2</sub> ratios </strong>to diagnose ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) regimes meaning if t<strong>he ozone production rates are sensitive to NOx (i.e., NOx-sensitive) or VOC (i.e., VOC-sensitive)</strong>. We show such a diagnosis cannot be performed <strong>in a robust manner</strong> unless we carefully quantify/mitigate <strong>four major sources of error</strong>: <strong>i) inherent chemical uncertainties associated with the approach of FNRs to diagnose sensitivity regimes <u>(20% error)</u>, ii) the capacity of tropospheric column satellite retrievals to represent the PBL- or surface-level environment (<u>19-37% error</u>), iii) spatial representativity of ground pixels of satellite sensors <u>(12-50% error)</u>, and iv) uncertainties associated with satellite-retrieved column-integrated concentrations of HCHO and NO<sub>2</sub> <u>(50-250%)</u>. </strong>We address all of them using a broad spectrum of tools and data. Furthermore, we will introduce a new metric that can be used in conjunction with the ratio to estimate the magnitude of PO3 &mdash; a pivotal quantify critical for understanding the spatial and temporal variability in locally-produced PO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

				<p>A <strong>critical</strong> error in the <strong>satellite</strong>-based observations or <strong>model</strong>-based fields is from <strong>unresolved spatial variability</strong> in trace gas concentrations <strong>within</strong> a satellite <strong>pixel</strong> or a model <strong>grid</strong> (Souri et al., 2022). The amount of spatial variability which is unresolved, or the <strong>representation error,</strong> can in principle be modeled if we base our reference on a distribution map made from a high spatial resolution dataset. We developed a method based on <strong>modeling isotropic semivariogram</strong> to quantify the amount of spatial information lost for different ground pixel sizes and length scales. Our method is compelling to understand and easy to apply to other products and different atmospheric environments. We developed an open-source package called SpaTial Representation Error EstimaTor (STREET) (https://github.com/ahsouri/STREET) based on this approach for everyone to use.</p>

					A fundamental <strong>taboo</strong> in satellites (and models) <strong>validation</strong> against <strong>pointwise</strong> measurements is&nbsp;the problem of scale:&nbsp;If one compares a <strong>grid box</strong> to a <strong>point sample</strong>, they are assuming that the point is representative of the grid; is such a comparison ever logical, in the sense that the average of the spatial distribution of the underlying compound is represented by a single value measured at a subgrid location?

Results demonstrate a <strong>promising improvement</strong> in the performance of the model in terms of <strong>HCHO and NO2 concentrations</strong>, which in turn, enable us to <strong>quantify </strong>the effect of the emission changes on different pathways of <strong>ozone </strong>formation/loss over <strong>East Asia</strong> relative to 2010

					A number of human-induced elements contribute to strengthening the intensity of tropical cyclones and prolonging their lifetime. Not only do ocean heat content, large-scale weather patterns, and surface properties influence the amount of release of energy, but <strong>the modulation from aerosol particles on cloud properties</strong> is also present. In <strong>warm-phase clouds</strong>, aerosols generally provide relatively <strong>large particles and/or lower vapor pressure surfaces</strong>, thereby facilitating the condensation of water vapor. Due to the non-linear processes involved in clouds microstructure, aerosol properties and the variability associated with the atmospheric environment, the quantification of the response of storms to aerosols is difficult. We used <strong>state-of-the-art chemical and weather models</strong> to quantify the impact of human-made aerosols on the amount of precipitation by Hurricane Harvey (2017). Results from the models suggest that <strong>a narrow band of polluted air</strong> from western Texas was transported <strong>over the Houston greater area</strong> at the moment when the convective system was active, i<strong>ntensifying the storm</strong> which led to an increase in rainfall by 8% (25 mm) on average. We show that the consequences of air pollution extend beyond health issues and reduced crop yields. As such, controls on emissions with respect to exacerbating severe weather should be more encouraged.

					Ozone formation is a <strong>non-linear function</strong> of NOx and VOC concentrations. So, a large number of <strong>proxy indicators </strong>have been proposed to know which precursor is the major driver for the formation/loss of ozone. Among these indicators,<strong> HCHO/NO2</strong> has <strong>ironically never been endorsed</strong> from a chemical point of view, as there are <strong>better choices </strong>for doing so such as the H2O2/HNO3 ratio explaining the ROx cycle. Nonetheless, due to the <strong>accessibility </strong>of the HCHO/NO2 ratios from several <strong>satellites</strong>, many scholars have leveraged them for classifying chemical condition regimes. There are several issues about using this ratio. An overlooked source of error lies in the fact that HCHO formation/loss heavily depends on NO2 concentrations. Therefore, we are required to provide <strong>various thresholds </strong>to be able to pinpoint accurately the<strong> transition line</strong> between NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive regimes. In our study, we <strong>reformulated</strong> the ratio to <strong>HCHO = a(NO2-b) </strong>following LNOx/LROx=2.7 <strong>accounting for the chemical feedback</strong>. The advantage of using this mathematical format over a ratio lies in the fact that it <strong>removes the need</strong> for providing a <strong>wide range of thresholds</strong> depending on the VOC environment.

					In order to improve the horizontal structure of an <strong>atmospheric river</strong> and the resultant precipitation, we assimilated the total water vapor columns from <strong>OMI </strong>using an <strong>analytical optimal estimation </strong>method. A zoom-in snapshot of a persistent atmospheric river in terms of integrated water vapor observed from SSMI, and modelled by the WRF on 6 November 2006 was shown in the left figure. On 6-7th November 2006, the atmospheric river so-called as “Pineapple express” introduced an unprecedented record-breaking rainfall over the Pacific Northwest. The atmospheric river simulated by the model was <strong>erroneously split into two narrow corridors</strong>. Furthermore, we observed that the model persistently <strong>overestimated</strong> the transported water vapor by 6% over the entire domain. Encouragingly, the errors in the bias and the horizontal pattern of the river <strong>were much improved using the data assimilation</strong>. Specifically, the unrealistically double-shaped corridors from the previous simulation vanished resulting in a <strong>better agreement </strong>with the observations.

					Although many studies have shown the capability of using <strong>space-borne</strong> remote sensing observations for monitoring emissions, the <strong>insufficient </strong>sample number and footprint of current measurements have introduced a burden to constrain emissions at <strong>fine scales</strong>. Promisingly, there are several air-borne sensors collected for NASA's campaigns providing high spatial resolution of NO2 columns. Here, we incorporated the well-characterized <strong>NO2</strong> columns from <strong>GCAS</strong> onboard NASA's B200 aircraft into a<strong> 1×1 km<sup>2</sup></strong> regional model to constrain anthropogenic <strong>NOx</strong> emissions in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area.

					After conducting an inverse modeling method using the Kalman filter, we find the GCAS observations are resourceful at mitigating the <strong>overprediction</strong> of <strong>model</strong> in reproducing NO2 on regular days.

					When estimating the <strong>impact of biomass burning</strong> on <strong>aerosols</strong>, a large<strong> source of uncertainty</strong> is associated with ignoring<strong> the ambient relative humidity and temperature</strong> that <strong>fires</strong> produced that might considerably influence the vapor and particulate phase <strong>partitioning</strong>. To estimate these physically-driven impacts, we firstly ran an idealized simulation using <strong>WRF-SFIRE</strong> for the brush (2 feet) fuel type in high spatial resolution (60 m). One hour after the ignition, the fire on average emitted 83 kWm-2 and 8 kWm-2 sensible and latent heat fluxes. The heat flux resulted in 4-8 K ambient <strong>temperature enhancement</strong> <strong>near </strong>the source. The enhanced temperature dried out the air near the fire by ~20% <strong>reduction in RH</strong>. However, the <strong>water released</strong> from biomass burning was <strong>vertically advected</strong> enhancing mixing ratio by 4-8 gkg-1 at the upper levels <strong>increasing the RH</strong> near to saturation point.

					The resultant changes in aerosols were <strong>significant</strong> for both urban (sulfate-rich) and non-urban aerosol (ammonia-rich) types using ISORROPIA II. Regarding the former type, in upper levels (&gt;500 m) where the RH increased substantially, HNO3 and H2SO4 were dissolved more efficiently yielding <strong>more particulate</strong> nitrate and sulfate. Concerning the latter, the concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ <strong>increased</strong> followed by a drop in those of NH3 and HNO3.

					For this research, we conducted a Bayesian inversion of <strong>OMI</strong> tropospheric NO2 to update anthropogenic sources of<strong> NEI-2011</strong> and soil-biogenic sources from BEIS3 (Biogenic Emission Inventory System version 3) over southeast Texas and west Louisiana during the 2013 DISCOVER-AQ Texas campaign. The inversion was done <strong>analytically</strong> so we used CMAQ-DDM to derive the jacobians.The inverse&nbsp;estimate suggests a<strong> reduction</strong> in area (44%), mobile (30%), and point sources (60%) in high NOx areas (ENOx&gt; 0.2 mol/s), and an <strong>increase</strong> in soil (∼52%) and area emissions (37%) in low NOx regions (ENOx&lt; 0.02 mol/s). We mitigated the overprediction of the model in reproducing surface NO2 when using the a posteriori emissions.&nbsp;

					The reduction in<strong> anthropogenic emissions</strong> in Houston might partially have led to the downward trend of MDA8 ozone during the&nbsp;summers (May-Sep) of&nbsp;2000-2014. But, without any doubt, <strong>meteorology</strong> can also play&nbsp;a big role in concentrations of ozone. We clustered regional wind patterns in Houston to investigate its respective changes and the corresponding surface ozone concentrations.<br>The highest ozone level belonged to C4 days, when weak easterly and <strong>northeasterly winds</strong> mixed high VOC emissions from the Houston Ship Channel with NOx emissions from the urban area, in addition to the <strong>transported ozone</strong> from the Eastern United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>declining trend in C4</strong> (82% in respect to 2000) provided evidence that the reduction in anthropogenic sources <strong>was not the only reason</strong> for the reduction in ozone exceedances (−1.5 ±0.6 day yr−1; 87% reduction in respect to 2000).&nbsp;<br>We found&nbsp;large <strong>negative</strong> slopes of MDA8 <strong>ozone</strong> within <strong>C4</strong> cluster in the&nbsp;summertime.The summertime trend for this cluster was&nbsp;found to be two times higher than the regional background ozone for northeasterly winds based on Berlin et al. (2013).This suggested that&nbsp;<strong>local emission</strong> <strong>reductions</strong> could be responsible for at least <strong>~50%</strong> reduction in <strong>high</strong> <strong>ozone</strong> levels in <strong>Houston.</strong>

					We used <strong>OMI</strong> HCHO and NO2 tropospheric columns to estimate their long-term trends in major urban cities in Texas. Due to governmental regulatory policies, we observed all cities experiencing <strong>downward trends</strong> in <strong>NO2</strong>; on the other hand, both <strong>positive</strong> and negative trends for <strong>OMI HCHO</strong> were seen. This might have resulted from climatic variabilities (<strong>positive</strong> feedback&nbsp;from <strong>biogenic emissions</strong>) and differences in anthropogenic VOC emissions changes.&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					The results show that<strong> prevailing chemical conditions</strong>&nbsp;can control the annual trends of surface ozone. While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO2 levels, a <strong>more prevailing NOx-sensitive</strong> regime over Austin resulted in its <strong>greater sensitivity to NO2</strong> changes. The dominant <strong>NOx-saturated</strong> regime over Dallas, however, led to its<strong> lower sensitivity</strong> to high annual downward trends of OMI NO2.&nbsp;

				In the past several decades, developing countries have witnessed high concentrations of air pollutants due to rapid growth in their population and a lack of advanced technology to mitigate them. In the middle east, due to the presence of a strong<strong> high-pressure </strong>system, abundant <strong>sunshine</strong>, large <strong>petrochemical industries</strong> and <strong>stratosphere-troposphere</strong>&nbsp;exchange, we detected significant ozone concentrations throughout the depth of the troposphere from <strong>OMI/MLS</strong> sensor (above ~ <strong>40 DU</strong>). The seasonality of ozone precursors and their long-term trends were also analyzed. NO2 and HCHO columns showed upward trends in Iran, while CO columns experienced downward mainly resulting from reduced CO emissions from Europe and USA. Overall, <strong>satellites</strong> can provide a lot of information for countries like Iran that lacks adequate monitoring systems.
