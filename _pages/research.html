					A fundamental <strong>taboo</strong> in satellites (and models) <strong>validation</strong> against <strong>pointwise</strong> measurements is&nbsp;the problem of scale:&nbsp;If one compares a <strong>grid box</strong> to a <strong>point sample</strong>, they are assuming that the point is representative of the grid; is such a comparison ever logical, in the sense that the average of the spatial distribution of the underlying compound is represented by a single value measured at a subgrid location?
				</p>

				<p>
					We leveraged some <strong>geostatistical</strong> tools to <strong>transform</strong> discrete points to gridded data with quantified <strong>uncertainty</strong>, comparable to satellite footprint (and response functions). This in part alleviated some complications concerning point–to-pixel comparisons.

There are <strong>few</strong> attempts to incorporate <strong>multi-sensors/multi-species</strong> in a way to properly consider the tangled relationships between atmospheric compounds such as the potential effect of oxidation and lifetime of one on another. For <strong>the first time</strong>, we provide a<strong> joint</strong> optimal estimate of <strong>NOx and NMVOC</strong> emissions during the KORUS-AQ campaign by simultaneously incorporating both SAO's new product of HCHO columns from OMPS and OMI tropospheric NO2 columns into a regional chemical transport model. Results demonstrate a <strong>promising improvement</strong> in the performance of the model in terms of <strong>HCHO and NO2 concentrations</strong>, which in turn, enable us to <strong>quantify </strong>the effect of the emission changes on different pathways of <strong>ozone </strong>formation/loss over <strong>East Asia</strong> relative to 2010

					A number of human-induced elements contribute to strengthening the intensity of tropical cyclones and prolonging their lifetime. Not only do ocean heat content, large-scale weather patterns, and surface properties influence the amount of release of energy, but <strong>the modulation from aerosol particles on cloud properties</strong> is also present. In <strong>warm-phase clouds</strong>, aerosols generally provide relatively <strong>large particles and/or lower vapor pressure surfaces</strong>, thereby facilitating the condensation of water vapor. Due to the non-linear processes involved in clouds microstructure, aerosol properties and the variability associated with the atmospheric environment, the quantification of the response of storms to aerosols is difficult. We used <strong>state-of-the-art chemical and weather models</strong> to quantify the impact of human-made aerosols on the amount of precipitation by Hurricane Harvey (2017). Results from the models suggest that <strong>a narrow band of polluted air</strong> from western Texas was transported <strong>over the Houston greater area</strong> at the moment when the convective system was active, i<strong>ntensifying the storm</strong> which led to an increase in rainfall by 8% (25 mm) on average. We show that the consequences of air pollution extend beyond health issues and reduced crop yields. As such, controls on emissions with respect to exacerbating severe weather should be more encouraged.

					Ozone formation is a <strong>non-linear function</strong> of NOx and VOC concentrations. So, a large number of <strong>proxy indicators </strong>have been proposed to know which precursor is the major driver for the formation/loss of ozone. Among these indicators,<strong> HCHO/NO2</strong> has <strong>ironically never been endorsed</strong> from a chemical point of view, as there are <strong>better choices </strong>for doing so such as the H2O2/HNO3 ratio explaining the ROx cycle. Nonetheless, due to the <strong>accessibility </strong>of the HCHO/NO2 ratios from several <strong>satellites</strong>, many scholars have leveraged them for classifying chemical condition regimes. There are several issues about using this ratio. An overlooked source of error lies in the fact that HCHO formation/loss heavily depends on NO2 concentrations. Therefore, we are required to provide <strong>various thresholds </strong>to be able to pinpoint accurately the<strong> transition line</strong> between NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive regimes. In our study, we <strong>reformulated</strong> the ratio to <strong>HCHO = a(NO2-b) </strong>following LNOx/LROx=2.7 <strong>accounting for the chemical feedback</strong>. The advantage of using this mathematical format over a ratio lies in the fact that it <strong>removes the need</strong> for providing a <strong>wide range of thresholds</strong> depending on the VOC environment.

					In order to improve the horizontal structure of an <strong>atmospheric river</strong> and the resultant precipitation, we assimilated the total water vapor columns from <strong>OMI </strong>using an <strong>analytical optimal estimation </strong>method. A zoom-in snapshot of a persistent atmospheric river in terms of integrated water vapor observed from SSMI, and modelled by the WRF on 6 November 2006 was shown in the left figure. On 6-7th November 2006, the atmospheric river so-called as “Pineapple express” introduced an unprecedented record-breaking rainfall over the Pacific Northwest. The atmospheric river simulated by the model was <strong>erroneously split into two narrow corridors</strong>. Furthermore, we observed that the model persistently <strong>overestimated</strong> the transported water vapor by 6% over the entire domain. Encouragingly, the errors in the bias and the horizontal pattern of the river <strong>were much improved using the data assimilation</strong>. Specifically, the unrealistically double-shaped corridors from the previous simulation vanished resulting in a <strong>better agreement </strong>with the observations.

					Although many studies have shown the capability of using <strong>space-borne</strong> remote sensing observations for monitoring emissions, the <strong>insufficient </strong>sample number and footprint of current measurements have introduced a burden to constrain emissions at <strong>fine scales</strong>. Promisingly, there are several air-borne sensors collected for NASA's campaigns providing high spatial resolution of NO2 columns. Here, we incorporated the well-characterized <strong>NO2</strong> columns from <strong>GCAS</strong> onboard NASA's B200 aircraft into a<strong> 1×1 km<sup>2</sup></strong> regional model to constrain anthropogenic <strong>NOx</strong> emissions in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area.
				</p>

				<p>
					After conducting an inverse modeling method using the Kalman filter, we find the GCAS observations are resourceful at mitigating the <strong>overprediction</strong> of <strong>model</strong> in reproducing NO2 on regular days. Moreover, the GCAS provides a unique opportunity to detect an <strong>anomaly in emissions</strong> which led to a strong air quality degradation.

				We examined how much <strong>biomass burning emissions </strong>contributed to <strong>inorganic aerosols</strong> through secondary pathways using a regional model in the US. We found that the <strong>increases</strong> in daily <strong>SO2</strong>, afternoon <strong>OH</strong> and <strong>H2O2</strong> accelerated the conversion of S(IV) and S(VI) families. This means that biomass burning can indirectly facilitate the sulfate formation by <strong>faster</strong> oxidizing of S(IV) from <strong>anthropogenic</strong> sources. Enhancements of daily surface <strong>NH3</strong> and <strong>HNO3</strong> also produced <strong>more</strong> particle-phase <strong>NH4NO3</strong>. Our model suggested that the major<strong> inorganic </strong>aerosols enhancement (mass) can reach <strong>23%</strong> of that of the <strong>carbonaceous</strong> aerosols.

					When estimating the <strong>impact of biomass burning</strong> on <strong>aerosols</strong>, a large<strong> source of uncertainty</strong> is associated with ignoring<strong> the ambient relative humidity and temperature</strong> that <strong>fires</strong> produced that might considerably influence the vapor and particulate phase <strong>partitioning</strong>. To estimate these physically-driven impacts, we firstly ran an idealized simulation using <strong>WRF-SFIRE</strong> for the brush (2 feet) fuel type in high spatial resolution (60 m). One hour after the ignition, the fire on average emitted 83 kWm-2 and 8 kWm-2 sensible and latent heat fluxes. The heat flux resulted in 4-8 K ambient <strong>temperature enhancement</strong> <strong>near </strong>the source. The enhanced temperature dried out the air near the fire by ~20% <strong>reduction in RH</strong>. However, the <strong>water released</strong> from biomass burning was <strong>vertically advected</strong> enhancing mixing ratio by 4-8 gkg-1 at the upper levels <strong>increasing the RH</strong> near to saturation point.
				</p>

				<p>
					The resultant changes in aerosols were <strong>significant</strong> for both urban (sulfate-rich) and non-urban aerosol (ammonia-rich) types using ISORROPIA II. Regarding the former type, in upper levels (&gt;500 m) where the RH increased substantially, HNO3 and H2SO4 were dissolved more efficiently yielding <strong>more particulate</strong> nitrate and sulfate. Concerning the latter, the concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ <strong>increased</strong> followed by a drop in those of NH3 and HNO3.

					The reduction in<strong> anthropogenic emissions</strong> in Houston might partially have led to the downward trend of MDA8 ozone during the&nbsp;summers (May-Sep) of&nbsp;2000-2014. But, without any doubt, <strong>meteorology</strong> can also play&nbsp;a big role in concentrations of ozone. We clustered regional wind patterns in Houston to investigate its respective changes and the corresponding surface ozone concentrations.<br>The highest ozone level belonged to C4 days, when weak easterly and <strong>northeasterly winds</strong> mixed high VOC emissions from the Houston Ship Channel with NOx emissions from the urban area, in addition to the <strong>transported ozone</strong> from the Eastern United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>declining trend in C4</strong> (82% in respect to 2000) provided evidence that the reduction in anthropogenic sources <strong>was not the only reason</strong> for the reduction in ozone exceedances (−1.5 ±0.6 day yr−1; 87% reduction in respect to 2000).&nbsp;<br>We found&nbsp;large <strong>negative</strong> slopes of MDA8 <strong>ozone</strong> within <strong>C4</strong> cluster in the&nbsp;summertime.The summertime trend for this cluster was&nbsp;found to be two times higher than the regional background ozone for northeasterly winds based on Berlin et al. (2013).This suggested that&nbsp;<strong>local emission</strong> <strong>reductions</strong> could be responsible for at least <strong>~50%</strong> reduction in <strong>high</strong> <strong>ozone</strong> levels in <strong>Houston.</strong>

					We used <strong>OMI</strong> HCHO and NO2 tropospheric columns to estimate their long-term trends in major urban cities in Texas. Due to governmental regulatory policies, we observed all cities experiencing <strong>downward trends</strong> in <strong>NO2</strong>; on the other hand, both <strong>positive</strong> and negative trends for <strong>OMI HCHO</strong> were seen. This might have resulted from climatic variabilities (<strong>positive</strong> feedback&nbsp;from <strong>biogenic emissions</strong>) and differences in anthropogenic VOC emissions changes.&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					The results show that<strong> prevailing chemical conditions</strong>&nbsp;can control the annual trends of surface ozone. While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO2 levels, a <strong>more prevailing NOx-sensitive</strong> regime over Austin resulted in its <strong>greater sensitivity to NO2</strong> changes. The dominant <strong>NOx-saturated</strong> regime over Dallas, however, led to its<strong> lower sensitivity</strong> to high annual downward trends of OMI NO2.&nbsp;

				In the past several decades, developing countries have witnessed high concentrations of air pollutants due to rapid growth in their population and a lack of advanced technology to mitigate them. In the middle east, due to the presence of a strong<strong> high-pressure </strong>system, abundant <strong>sunshine</strong>, large <strong>petrochemical industries</strong> and <strong>stratosphere-troposphere</strong>&nbsp;exchange, we detected significant ozone concentrations throughout the depth of the troposphere from <strong>OMI/MLS</strong> sensor (above ~ <strong>40 DU</strong>). The seasonality of ozone precursors and their long-term trends were also analyzed. NO2 and HCHO columns showed upward trends in Iran, while CO columns experienced downward mainly resulting from reduced CO emissions from Europe and USA. Overall, <strong>satellites</strong> can provide a lot of information for countries like Iran that lacks adequate monitoring systems.
