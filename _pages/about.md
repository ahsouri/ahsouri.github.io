__I am an associate research scientist working at NASA GSFC at Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics (614) lab and GESTAR II (Morgan State University).__
I have pursued research on a range of diverse topics, including:

- Prediction of net ozone production rates from space using ML ([CheckHere](https://www.ozonerates.space))
- Inverse modeling/data assimilation including LETKF, 3Dvar, analytical non-linear inversion, multi-sensor/multi-species
- Atmospheric modeling including simulations of atmospheric chemistry over southeast Texas, CONUS, East Asia, and Europe; dynamics of hurricanes such as Harvey and severe weather events such as heatwaves
- Idealized simulation such as 0-D chemical box modeling
- Tropospheric ozone and OH: trend and sensitivity to meteorology and precursors/proxies
- Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) designed for satellites (e.g., MethaneSAT)
- Data analysis and retrievals/models validation
- Spatial heterogeneity modeling

Please check my [CV](cv) or [Research](research) for specific studies that I have worked on.
