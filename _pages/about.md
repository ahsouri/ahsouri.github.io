======
I am an atmospheric physicist at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics under supervision Dr. Kelly Chance who is one of the pioneers in trace gases retrievals from satellites, and the PI of TEMPO.
======
I have pursued research on a range of diverse topics, including:

- Inverse modeling/Data Assimilation including LETKF, 3Dvar, analytical non-linear inversion, multi-sensor/multi-species
- Atmospheric modeling including simulations of atmospheric chemistry over southeast Texas, CONUS, East Asia and Europe, dynamics of hurricane Harvey and severe weather such as heatwaves
- Tropospheric ozone: trend and sensitivity to meteorology and precursors
- MethaneSAT OSSE
- Data analysis and satellite validation
- Spatial heterogeneity modeling

Please check my CV or Research web pages for specific studies that I've worked on.
