	abstract = {Reliable emission inventories are key to precisely model air pollutant concentrations. The relatively large reduction in NOx emissions that is well corroborated by satellite and in-situ observations over southeast Texas has resulted in discrepancies between observations and regional model simulations based on the National Emission Inventory (NEI) provided every three years in U.S. In this study, a Bayesian inversion of OMI tropospheric NO2 is conducted to update anthropogenic sources of NEI-2011 and soil-biogenic sources from BEIS3 (Biogenic Emission Inventory System version 3) over southeast Texas and west Louisiana during the 2013 DISCOVER-AQ Texas campaign. Results reveal that influences of the a priori profile used in OMI NO2 retrieval play a significant role in inconsistencies between model and satellite observations, which should be mitigated. A posteriori emissions are produced using the regional Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model associated with Decoupled Direct Method (DDM) sensitivity analysis. The inverse estimate suggests a reduction in area (44\%), mobile (30\%), and point sources (60\%) in high NOx areas (ENOx{\textgreater} 0.2 mol/s), and an increase in soil (∼52\%) and area emissions (37\%) in low NOx regions (ENOx{\textless} 0.02 mol/s). The reductions in anthropogenic sources in high NOx regions are attributed to both uncertainty of the priori and emissions policies, while increases in area and soil-biogenic emissions more likely resulted from under-estimation of ships emissions, and the Yienger- Levy scheme used in BEIS respectively. In order to validate the accuracy of updated NOx emissions, CMAQ simulation was performed and results were evaluated with independent surface NO2 measurements. Comparing to surface monitoring sites, we find improvements (before and after inverse modeling) for MB (1.95, −0.30 ppbv), MAB (3.65, 2.60 ppbv), RMSE (6.13, 4.37 ppbv), correlation (0.68, 0.69), and IOA (0.76, 0.82). The largest improvement is seen for morning time surface NO2 for which RMSE and MB are reduced considerably by ∼60\% (5.05 to 2.07 ppbv) and 109\% (3.49 to −0.3 ppbv). However, under-prediction of model NO2 in Houston on 09/25–09/26 likely resulting from unprecedented local NOx sources from the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) becomes more evident. Overall, results show that use of OMI tropospheric NO2 columns can substantially reduce the uncertainty of bottom-up emissions for a regional study which should be extended to larger domains (e.g. entire U.S. or North America).},

	abstract = {Recent regulatory policies in East Asia reduce ozone precursors, but these changes are spatially and temporally nonuniform. This study investigates variations in the long-term trends of tropospheric NO2, HCHO, and HCHO/NO2 ratios to diagnose ozone sensitivity to changes in NOx and volatile organic compound using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Using an adaptive-degree polynomial filter, we identify extremums of time series of NO2 to determine when and how NO2 change. Due to the regulations in China, trends which were predominantly upward turned downward. The years undergoing these changes primarily happened in 2011 and 2012. OMI column densities, however, suggest that NOx sources in South Korea, the Pearl River Delta (PRD), Taiwan, and Japan have not consistently decreased. Specifically, as Chinese exports of NO2 started subsiding, increasing trends in NO2 columns over several Korean cities, including Seoul, become evident. To quantify the changes in NOx emissions from summertime 2010 to 2014, we conduct a 3D-Var inverse modeling using a regional model with MIX-Asia inventory and estimate NOx emissions (in 2010 and 2014) for the PRD (1.6 and 1.5 Gg/d), the Yangtze River Delta (3.9 and 3.0 Gg/d), north China (15.6 and 14.3 Gg/d), South Korea (1.6 and 1.5 Gg/d), and Japan (2.7 and 2.6 Gg/d). OMI HCHO shows upward trends in East Asia resulting from anthropogenic effects; however, the magnitudes are negative in the PRD, Japan, North Korea, and Taiwan. OMI HCHO/NO2 ratios reveal that while South Korea, Japan, and the south of China have undergone toward more NOx-sensitive regime, areas around the Bohai Sea have become more NOx saturated.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a long-term (2005–2013) analysis of tropospheric NO2 and HCHO using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite and surface ozone using the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s Continuous Ambient Monitoring Stations (CAMS) sites in large cities of Texas. Rather than focusing solely on seasonal changes, the authors consider other harmonic changes using Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE), which reduces uncertainty in trends by 5–15\%. Tropospheric NO2 observed from OMI demonstrated a downward trend in Austin (−0.06±0.02×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Dallas (−0.21±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Fort Worth (−0.16±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Houston (−0.14±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), and San Antonio (−0.07±0.02×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1). These decreasing trends could be attributed to efficient emission control policies. The OMI HCHO observations exhibited both negative and positive annual trends in Austin (+0.09±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Dallas (−0.01±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Fort Worth (−0.04±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Houston (−0.06±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), and San Antonio (+0.01±0.03×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1) mainly resulting from differences in decreases in anthropogenic emissions, the impact of climatic variations and biogenic emissions. The discrepancy between the annual trends of HCHO and NO2 provides strong evidence that all of the cities gradually became more NOx-sensitive. We obtained the slope of HCHO/NO2 ratios (a proxy for chemical condition) from OMI for Austin (0.10±0.04yr−1), Dallas (0.08±0.03yr−1), Fort Worth (0.07±0.03yr−1), Houston (0.06±0.03yr−1), and San Antonio (0.08±0.03yr−1) and investigate the 1–2pm local time surface ozone patterns along with maximum, annual, and minimum trends in relation to changes in their precursors and prevailing chemical conditions. The surface levels of wintertime ozone measured by the CAMS network were seen to increase in Austin (0.90±0.53ppbvyr−1), Dallas (0.62±0.53ppbvyr−1), Fort Worth (0.59±0.40ppbvyr−1), Houston (0.56±0.55ppbvyr−1), and San Antonio (0.64±0.54ppbvyr−1) because of the reduction in the amount of ozone quenched through NOx titration. Summertime ozone surface mixing ratio trends are mainly governed by NO2 annual trends as well as climatic influences. We obtained the downward annual trend of the ozone mixing ratio from CAMS observations for Austin (−0.27±0.17ppbvyr−1), Dallas (−0.41±0.18ppbvyr−1), Fort Worth (−0.55±0.18ppbvyr−1), Houston (−0.53±0.18ppbvyr−1), and San Antonio (−0.03±0.16ppbvyr−1). The results show that prevailing chemical conditions control the annual trends of surface ozone. While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO2 levels, a more prevailing NOx-sensitive regime over Austin resulted in its greater sensitivity to NO2 changes. The dominant NOx-saturated regime over Dallas, however, led to its lower sensitivity to high annual downward trends of OMI NO2. To investigate the impact of reductions in ozone precursors on surface ozone, we employ the WRF-Chem regional model to simulate NO2, HCHO, and O3 levels in September 2013 in two scenarios using National Emissions Inventory 2005 (NEI-2005) and NEI-2011 anthropogenic emissions. The model describes a decrease in ozone levels from the first to second scenario in Dallas (3\%) and Forth Worth (0.5\%) but an increase in Austin, San Antonio, and Houston (0.7\%, 0.8\%, and 7\%, respectively), which may be attributed to uncertainty in VOC concentrations and overestimation of NOx in the NEI-2005 inventory that led to inaccurate HCHO/NO2 ratios. The results indicate that the emission uncertainties should be constrained to better inform emissions control policy based on air quality modeling.},

	abstract = {Houston is recognized for its large petrochemical industrial facilities providing abundant radicals for tropospheric ozone formation. Fortunately, maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) surface ozone concentrations have declined in Houston (−0.6±0.3ppbvyr−1) during the summers (i.e., May to September) of 2000 to 2014, possibly due to the reductions in precursor emissions by effective control policies. However, it is also possible that changes in meteorological variables have affected ozone concentrations. This study focused on the impact of long-term wind patterns which have the highest impact on ozone in Houston. The analysis of long-term wind patterns can benefit surface ozone studies by 1) providing wind patterns that distinctly changed ozone levels, 2) investigating the frequency of patterns and the respective changes and 3) estimating ozone trends in specific wind patterns that local emissions are mostly involved, thus separating emissions impacts from meteorology to some extent. To this end, the 900-hPa flow patterns in summers of 2000 to 2014 were clustered in seven classes (C1–C7) by deploying an unsupervised partitioning method. We confirm the characteristics of the clusters from a backward trajectory analysis, monitoring networks, and a regional chemical transport model simulation. The results indicate that Houston has experienced a statistically significant downward trend (−0.6±0.4dayyr−1) of the cluster of weak easterly and northeasterly days (C4), when the highest fraction of ozone exceedances (MDA8{\textgreater}70ppbv) occurred. This suggests that the reduction in ozone precursors was not the sole reason for the decrease in ozone exceedance days (−1.5±0.6dayyr−1). Further, to examine the efficiency of control policies intended to reduce the amount of ozone, we estimated the trend of MDA8 ozone in C4 and C5 (weak winds) days when local emissions are primarily responsible for high ambient ozone levels. Both C4 and C5 show a large reduction in the 95th percentile and summertime trends mainly due to effective control strategies. Based on the 5th percentile daytime ozone for C1 (strong southeasterly wind) in coastal sites, this study found that the cleanest air masses that Houston received became more polluted during the summer of 2000–2014 by 1–3ppbv. Though this study focused on Houston, the analysis method presented could generally be used to estimate ozone trends in other regions where surface ozone is dominantly influenced by both wind patterns and local emissions.},

	abstract = {To identify spatial and temporal variations over the Iranian region, this study analyzed tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), carbon monoxide (CO) columns from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), and tropospheric column O3 (TCO) from OMI/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) satellites from 2005 to 2012. The study discovered high levels of HCHO (∼12 × 1015 molec./cm2) from plant isoprene emissions in the air above parts of the northern forest of Iran during the summer and from the oxidation of HCHO precursors emitted from petrochemical industrial facilities and biomass burning in South West Iran. This study showed that maximum NO2 levels (∼18 × 1015 molec./cm2) were concentrated in urban cities, indicating the predominance of anthropogenic sources. The results indicate that maximum concentrations were found in the winter, mainly because of weaker local winds and higher heating fuel consumption, in addition to lower hydroxyl radicals (OH). The high CO concentrations (∼2 × 1018 molec./cm2) in the early spring were inferred to mainly originate from a strong continental air mass from anthropogenic CO “hotspots” including regions around Caspian Sea, Europe, and North America, although the external sources of CO were partly suppressed by the Arabian anticyclone and topographic barriers. Variations in the TCO were seen to peak during the summer (∼40 DU), due to intensive solar radiation and stratospheric sources. This study also examined long-term trends in TCO and its precursors over a period of eight years in five urban cities in Iran. To perform the analysis, we estimated seasonal changes and inter-seasonal variations using least-squares harmonic estimation (LS-HE), which reduced uncertainty in the trend by 5–15\%. The results showed significant increases in the levels of HCHO (∼0.08 ± 0.06 × 1015 molec./cm2 yr−1), NO2 (∼0.08 ± 0.02 × 1015 molec./cm2 yr−1), and peak annual TCO (∼0.59 ± 0.56 DU yr−1) but decreases in minimum annual TCO (∼−0.42 ± 0.60 DU yr−1) caused by an increase in NO2 species and annual CO (∼−0.95 ± 0.41 × 1016 molec./cm2 yr−1) partly resulting from the transport of reduced CO. The time series of the HCHO/NO2 column ratio (a proxy for the chemical conditions) indicated that during the last decade, the cities of Tehran, Ahvaz, and Isfahan exhibited steady chemical conditions while Tabriz and Mashhad exhibited a change from NOx-saturated/mixed to more NOx-sensitive chemical conditions.},

	abstract = {A WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modeling system was used to study Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions and their impact on surface VOC and ozone concentrations in southeast Texas during September 2013. The model was evaluated against the ground-level Automated Gas Chromatograph (Auto-GC) measurement data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The comparisons indicated that the model over-predicted benzene, ethylene, toluene and xylene, while under-predicting isoprene and ethane. The mean biases between simulated and observed values of each VOC species showed clear daytime, nighttime, weekday and weekend variations. Adjusting the VOC emissions using simulated/observed ratios improved model performance of each VOC species, especially mitigating the mean bias substantially. Simulated monthly mean ozone showed a minor change: a 0.4 ppb or 1.2\% increase; while a change of more than 5 ppb was seen in hourly ozone data on high ozone days, this change moved model predictions closer to observations. The CMAQ model run with the adjusted emissions better reproduced the variability in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) formaldehyde (HCHO) columns. The adjusted model scenario also slightly better reproduced the aircraft HCHO concentrations from NASA's DISCOVER-AQ campaign conducted during the simulation episode period; Correlation, Mean Bias and RMSE improved from 0.34, 1.38 ppb and 2.15 ppb to 0.38, 1.33 ppb and 2.08 ppb respectively. A process analysis conducted for both industrial/urban and rural areas suggested that chemistry was the main process contributing to ozone production in both areas, while the impact of chemistry was smaller in rural areas than in industrial and urban areas. For both areas, the positive chemistry contribution increased in the sensitivity simulation largely due to the increase in emissions. Nudging VOC emissions to match the observed concentrations shifted the ozone hotspots outside the industrial/urban region and enhanced the peaked ozone in the outflow region with consistent southerly/southeasterly winds during the afternoon time (1–5 pm). This study helps in the understanding of these processes which are critical to constrain high peak ozone values in the outflow regions. The results indicate that formation of ozone in the outflow could complicate attainment status in neighboring counties.},

The new version of STOPS (v1.5) has been implemented into the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model version 5.0.2. The STOPS modeling system is a moving nest (Lagrangian approach) between the source and the receptor inside the host Eulerian CMAQ model. The proposed model generates simulation results that are relatively consistent with those of CMAQ but within a comparatively shorter computational time period. We find that standard CMAQ generally underestimates PM$_{\textrm{10}}$ concentrations during the simulation period (February 2015) and fails to capture PM$_{\textrm{10}}$ peaks during Asian dust events (22–24 February 2015). The underestimation in PM$_{\textrm{10}}$ concentration is very likely due to missing dust emissions in CMAQ rather than incorrectly simulated meteorology, as the model meteorology agrees well with the observations. To improve the underestimated PM$_{\textrm{10}}$ results from CMAQ, we used the STOPS model with constrained PM concentrations based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), reflecting real-time initial and boundary conditions of dust particles near the Korean Peninsula. The simulated PM$_{\textrm{10}}$ from the STOPS simulations were improved significantly and closely matched the surface observations. With additional verification of the capabilities of the methodology on emission estimations and more STOPS simulations for various time periods, the STOPS model could prove to be a useful tool not just for the predictions of Asian dust but also for other unexpected events such as wildfires and oil spills.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A number of satellite-based instruments have become an essential part of monitoring emissions. Despite sound theoretical inversion techniques, the insufficient samples and the footprint size of current observations have introduced an obstacle to narrow the inversion window for regional models. These key limitations can be partially resolved by a set of modest high-quality measurements from airborne remote sensing. This study illustrates the feasibility of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns from the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events Airborne Simulator (GCAS) to constrain anthropogenic NOx emissions in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area. We convert slant column densities to vertical columns using a radiative transfer model with (i) NO2 profiles from a high-resolution regional model (1 × 1 km2) constrained by P-3B aircraft measurements, (ii) the consideration of aerosol optical thickness impacts on radiance at NO2 absorption line, and (iii) high-resolution surface albedo constrained by ground-based spectrometers. We characterize errors in the GCAS NO2 columns by comparing them to Pandora measurements and find a striking correlation (r {\textgreater} 0.74) with an uncertainty of 3.5 × 1015 molecules cm−2. On 9 of 10 total days, the constrained anthropogenic emissions by a Kalman filter yield an overall 2–50\% reduction in polluted areas, partly counterbalancing the well-documented positive bias of the model. The inversion, however, boosts emissions by 94\% in the same areas on a day when an unprecedented local emissions event potentially occurred, significantly mitigating the bias of the model. The capability of GCAS at detecting such an event ensures the significance of forthcoming geostationary satellites for timely estimates of top-down emissions.},

	abstract = {Air quality simulations were conducted using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for nocturnal isoprene in September 2013 using the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National Emissions Inventory of 2011 (NEI, 2011). The results were evaluated against measurements collected at eight Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Automated Gas Chromatographs (AutoGCs) monitoring stations. The comparisons demonstrated two distinctive behaviors: overestimation before midnight (20:00–23:00p.m. local time) versus underestimation after midnight (00:00–06:00a.m.). Analyses identify the uncertainties in nitrate radical (NO3) concentration and vertical mixing as the possible minor factors contributing to the underestimation, and the underestimated wind speed as the major factor contributing to the overestimation. Further analysis links isoprene underestimation to the uncertainties in the nocturnal isoprene anthropogenic emissions in the NEI (2011) over industrial areas in Houston. This can be substantiated by the fact that the observed nighttime isoprene concentrations increased when the wind direction veered back from southeast to northeast, placing the stations downwind of industrial facilities. A sensitivity run with adjusted anthropogenic isoprene emissions in the later part of the night (i.e., the emissions were multiplied by the hourly underestimation factors ranging from 3.81 to 14.82) yielded closer isoprene predictions after midnight with slightly improved model mean (0.15 to 0.20ppb), mean error (−0.10 to −0.04ppb), mean absolute error (0.18 to 0.15ppb), root mean squared error (RMSE, 0.27 to 0.25ppb), and index of agreement (IOA, 0.66 to 0.68). The insignificant improvement was likely due to the uncertainties in the location of the high-peaked anthropogenic emissions. The impacts of the nighttime-adjusted isoprene emissions on the isoprene oxidation products, organic nitrate and ozone, were found to be minimal. This study, however, shows that more in-situ surface nighttime measurement data is critical to constrain the underestimated nocturnal isoprene emissions in Houston.},

	abstract = {Dust storms are important phenomena over large regions of the arid and semi-arid areas of the Middle East. Due to the influences of dust aerosols on climate and human daily activities, dust detection plays a crucial role in environmental and climatic studies. Detection of dust storms is critical to accurately understand dust, their properties and distribution. Currently, remotely sensed data such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) with appropriate temporal and spectral resolutions have been widely used for this purpose. This paper investigates the capability of two physical-based methods, and random forests (RF) classifier, for the first time, to detect dust storms using MODIS imagery. Since the physical-based approaches are empirical, they suffer from certain drawbacks such as high variability of thresholds depending on the underlying surface. Therefore, classification-based approaches could be deployed as an alternative. In this paper, the most relevant bands are chosen based on the physical effects of the major classes, particularly dust, cloud and snow, on both emissive infrared and reflective bands. In order to verify the capability of the methods, OMAERUV AAOD (aerosol absorption optical depth) product from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) sensor is exploited. In addition, some small regions are selected manually to be considered as ground truth for measuring the probability of false detection (POFD) and probability of missing detection (POMD). The dust class generated by RF is consistent qualitatively with the location and extent of dust observed in OMERAUV and MODIS true colour images. Quantitatively, the dust classes generated for eight dust outbreaks in the Middle East are found to be accurate from 7\% and 6\% of POFD and POMD respectively. Moreover, results demonstrate the sound capability of RF in classifying dust plumes over both water and land simultaneously. The performance of the physical-based approaches is found weaker than RF due to empirical thresholds that are not always true.},

	abstract = {Over the last five decades, Earth’s atmosphere has been extensively monitored from space using different spectral ranges. Early efforts were directed at improving weather forecasts with the first meteorological satellites launched in the 1960s. Soon thereafter, the intersection between weather, climate and atmospheric chemistry led to the observation of atmospheric composition from space. During the 1970s the Nimbus satellite program started regular monitoring of ozone integrated columns and water vapor profiles using the Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrometer, the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer and the Satellite Infrared Spectrometer instruments. Five decades after these pioneer efforts, continuous progress in instrument design, and retrieval techniques allow researchers to monitor tropospheric concentrations of a wide range of species with implications for air quality, climate and weather. The time line of historic, present and future space-borne instruments measuring ultraviolet and visible backscattered solar radiation designed to quantify atmospheric trace gases is presented. We describe the instruments technological evolution and the basic concepts of retrieval theory. We include a review of algorithms developed for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, bromine monoxide, water vapor and glyoxal, a selection of studies using these algorithms, the challenges they face and how these challenges can be addressed. The paper ends by providing insights on the opportunities that new instruments will bring to the atmospheric chemistry, weather and air quality communities and how to address the pressing need for long-term, inter-calibrated data records necessary to monitor the response of the atmosphere to rapidly changing ecosystems.},

	abstract = {This study investigates a significant biomass burning (BB) event occurred in Colorado of the United States in 2012 using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The simulation reasonably reproduced the significantly high upper tropospheric O3 concentrations (up to 145ppb) caused by BB emissions. We find the BB-induced O3 was primarily affected by chemical reactions and dispersion during its transport. In the early period of transport, high NOx and VOCs emissions caused O3 production due to reactions with the peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, HO2 and OH. Here, NOx played a key role in O3 formation in the BB plume. The results indicated that HO2 in the BB plume primarily came from formaldehyde (HCHO+hv=2HO2+CO), a secondary alkoxy radical (ROR=HO2). CO played an important role in the production of recycled HO2 (OH+CO=HO2) because of its abundance in the BB plume. The chemically produced HO2 was largely converted to OH by the reactions with NO (HO2+NO=OH+NO2) from BB emissions. This is in contrast to the surface, where HO2 and OH are strongly affected by VOC and HONO, respectively. In the late stages of transport, the O3 concentration was primarily controlled by dispersion. It stayed longer in the upper troposphere compared to the surface due to sustained depletion of NOx. Sensitivity analysis results support that O3 in the BB plume is significantly more sensitive to NOx than VOCs.},

	abstract = {Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is one of the key parameters for the analysis of global climate systems, formation of clouds, and short-term forecasts of precipitation. Since water vapor is highly variable both spatially and temporally, it can be problematic, requiring modeling and efficient techniques in order to measure its quantity. Global Positioning System (GPS) stations provide total water column at high quality under all weather conditions with high temporal resolution. The technique used in this work is Precise Point Positioning (PPP) for single dual-frequency GPS receiver aided by precise orbit and clock product. Zenith wet delay (ZWD) is estimated through a stochastic process called random walk at 5-min intervals. The seasonal and diurnal variations of PWV for four GPS stations located in Europe are investigated. Latitude and station height are the most influential factors for the amount of water vapor when we compare their amplitudes and offsets to NASA Water Vapor Dataset-M (NVAP-M) and station heights. The area-averaged accumulated rain time series retrieved from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) product also shows that high PWV levels do not necessarily lead to rainfall. The amplitudes of diurnal and semi-diurnal variations are found to be of much lower amount than those of seasonal variations. In order to validate the capability of GPS-sensed PWV measurements, two episodes in wintertime and summertime are simulated using Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model. Both simulated PWV and observational PWV are consistent with each other. The main objective of this paper is to model and forecast the PWV time series which would be useful information on climatology and meteorology. Due to the distinct harmonic characteristics of PWV time series, the least squares harmonic estimation (LS-HE) is applied to time series of PWV derived from 4-year GPS station observations. Subsequently, least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) optimized by cross-validation strategy is used to model non-harmonic components of the signal. The underlying motivation for using LS-SVM is the proficiency of this methodology to precisely model time series data when the underlying model is usually non-stationary, not defined a priori, and non-linear which are major characteristics of PWV data. The modeled time series shows that the hybrid approach (LS-HE and LS-SVM) can efficiently filter white noise in the observations and then perform forecasting. The bias (∼0.37 mm) and standard deviation (∼3 mm) of observed and predicted values presents the sound capability of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {During the summer of 2015, a number of large wildfires burned across Northern California in areas of localized topographic relief. Persistent valley smoke hindered fire-fighting efforts, delayed helicopter operations, and exposed communities to extreme concentrations of particulate matter. It was hypothesized that smoke from the wildfires reduced the amount of incoming solar radiation reaching the ground, which resulted in near-surface cooling, while smoke aerosols resulted in warming aloft. As a result of increased inversion-like conditions, smoke from wildfires was trapped within mountain valleys adjacent to active wildfires. In this study, wildfire smoke-induced inversion episodes across Northern California were examined using a modeling framework that couples an atmospheric, chemical, and fire spread model. Modeling results examined in this study indicate that wildfire smoke reduced incoming solar radiation during the afternoon, which lead to local surface cooling by up to 3 °C, which agrees with cooling observed at nearby surface stations. Direct heating from the fire itself did not significantly enhance atmospheric stability. However, midlevel warming (+0.5 °C) and pronounced surface cooling was observed in the smoke layer, indicating that smoke aerosols significantly enhanced atmospheric stability. A positive feedback associated with the presence of smoke was observed, where local smoke-enhanced inversions inhibited the growth of the planetary boundary layer, and reduced surface winds, which resulted in smoke accumulation that further reduced near-surface temperatures. This work suggests that the inclusion of fire-smoke-atmosphere feedback in a coupled modeling framework such as WRF-SFIRE-CHEM can forecast the dispersion of wildfire smoke and its radiative feedback, and potentially provide decision-support for wildfire operations.},

We designed three model simulations to observe the impact of AOD assimilation and aerosol feedback during the KORUS-AQ campaign (May–June 2016). By assimilating the GOCI AOD with high temporal and spatial resolutions, we improve the statistics from the comparison AOD and AERONET data (root-mean-square error: 0.12, R: 0.77, index of agreement: 0.69, mean-absolute error: 0.08). The inclusion of the direct effect of aerosols produces the best model performance (root-mean-square error: 0.10, R: 0.86, index of agreement: 0.72, mean-absolute error: 0.07). AOD values increased as much as 0.15, which is associated with an average reduction in solar radiation of -31.39 W/m2, a planetary boundary layer height (-104.70 m), an air temperature (-0.58 °C), and a surface wind speed (-0.07 m/s) over land. In addition, concentrations of major gaseous and particulate pollutants at the surface (SO2, NO2, NH3, , , , and PM2.5) increase by 7.87–34\%, while OH concentration decreases by -4.58\%. Changes in meteorology and air quality appear to be more significant in high-aerosol loading areas. The integrated process rate analysis shows decelerated vertical transport, resulting in an accumulation of air pollutants near the surface and the amount of nitrate, which is higher than that of sulfate because of its response to reduced temperature. We conclude that constraining aerosol concentrations using geostationary satellite data is a prerequisite for quantifying the impact of aerosols on meteorology and air quality.},

Using a clustering algorithm called “self-organizing maps,” we analyzed five notable characteristic regional wind patterns that occurred between April and October in 2000–14. A regional-scale high pressure system, cluster 2, produced weak southeast winds over DFW and accounted for 35.2\% of ozone exceedances. Clusters 1 and 5, characterized by southwesterly winds over the DFW area, were together associated with one-third of total ozone exceedances and show quantifiable impacts of the Barnett Shale region on downwind ozone production. Cluster 3, associated with Bermuda-high conditions, had relatively lower ozone in DFW (45.3 ppbv) resulting from transport of lower background ozone from the Gulf of Mexico. For clusters that produce southeasterly or southwesterly winds over Houston, ozone values in DFW were always larger than those in Houston. Further, to determine the potential impact of Houston pollution on DFW ozone, a sensitivity simulation with no Houston emissions and a base simulation were performed. The difference between the simulations revealed ozone enhancements of 1–2 ppbv and coincident enhancements in NOy under south-southeasterly wind conditions. From these results, we conclude that downwind pollution from Houston and the Barnett Shale area exacerbates DFW ozone concentrations, underscoring the impacts of specific wind patterns on air quality in DFW.},

	abstract = {The primary sources for inorganic aerosols from biomass burning are rather negligible, but they are predominantly formed chemically following emission of their precursors (e.g., SO2, NH3, HOx, and NOx). The biomass burning contributions to some of the precursors can be considerable. Accordingly, we quantify the impact of the emissions on major inorganic aerosols in April–October 2012–2014 using a regional model simulation verified by extensive surface observations throughout the U.S. Simulated CO enhancements on an hourly basis are used to classify the U.S. into weak-moderate (5 {\textless} COBiomass-COBase {\textless} 20 ppbv) and strongly impacted periods (COBiomass-COBase {\textgreater} 20 ppbv). This separation not only facilitates the identification of the spatial frequency of the impact but also helps to filter out nonimpacted periods, enabling us to focus on long-term contributions. Despite the nonlinear responses of several trace gases to emissions, we observe increases (weak-moderate and strong) in daily surface SO42− (1.16 ± 0.32 and 6.57 ± 4.65 nmol/m3), NO3− (0.36 ± 0.63, 4.70 ± 7.05 nmol/m3), and NH4+ (2.70 ± 0.92 and 17.82 ± 15.17 nmol/m3) on a national scale. These primarily resulted from (i) increases in daily surface SO2 (0.02 ± 0.01 and 0.10 ± 0.07 ppbv), afternoon OH (1.28 ± 4.24 and 12.82 ± 23.76 ppqv), and H2O2 (0.06 ± 0.02 and 0.10 ± 0.08 ppbv), which may have accelerated the conversion of S(IV) to S(VI), and (ii) increases in daily surface NH3 (1.08 ± 0.73 and 8.61 ± 7.73 nmol/m3) and HNO3 (1.44 ± 0.48 and 7.15 ± 4.25 nmol/m3), which could have produced more particle-phase NH4NO3. In the West, where atmospheric moisture is limited, enhanced SO42− leaves less available water for NH4NO3 to become ions. Our results suggest that the major inorganic aerosol enhancement (mass) can reach to 23\% of that of the carbonaceous aerosols.},

	abstract = {The nonlinear chemical processes involved in ozone production (P(O3)) have necessitated using proxy indicators to convey information about the primary dependence of P(O3) on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or nitrogen oxides (NOx). In particular, the ratio of remotely sensed columns of formaldehyde (HCHO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has been widely used for studying O3 sensitivity. Previous studies found that the errors in retrievals and the incoherent relationship between the column and the near-surface concentrations are a barrier in applying the ratio in a robust way. In addition to these obstacles, we provide calculational-observational evidence, using an ensemble of 0-D photochemical box models constrained by DC-8 aircraft measurements on an ozone event during the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign over Seoul, to demonstrate the chemical feedback of NO2 on the formation of HCHO is a controlling factor for the transition line between NOx-sensitive and NOx-saturated regimes. A fixed value (∼2.7) of the ratio of the chemical loss of NOx (LNOx) to the chemical loss of HO2+RO2 (LROx) perceptibly differentiates the regimes. Following this value, data points with a ratio of HCHO/NO2 less than 1 can be safely classified as NOx-saturated regime, whereas points with ratios between 1 and 4 fall into one or the other regime. We attribute this mainly to the HCHO-NO2 chemical relationship causing the transition line to occur at larger (smaller) HCHO/NO2 ratios in VOC-rich (VOC-poor) environments. We then redefine the transition line to LNOx/LROx∼2.7 that accounts for the HCHO-NO2 chemical relationship leading to HCHO = 3.7 × (NO2 – 1.14 × 1016 molec.cm-2). Although the revised formula is locally calibrated (i.e., requires for readjustment for other regions), its mathematical format removes the need for having a wide range of thresholds used in HCHO/NO2 ratios that is a result of the chemical feedback. Therefore, to be able to properly take the chemical feedback into consideration, the use of HCHO = a × (NO2 – b) formula should be preferred to the ratio in future works. We then use the Geostationary Trace gas and Aerosol Sensor Optimization (GeoTASO) airborne instrument to study O3 sensitivity in Seoul. The unprecedented spatial (250 × 250 m2) and temporal (∼every 2 h) resolutions of HCHO and NO2 observations form the sensor enhance our understanding of P(O3) in Seoul; rather than providing a crude label for the entire city, more in-depth variabilities in chemical regimes are observed that should be able to inform mitigation strategies correspondingly.},

	abstract = {A number of human-induced elements contribute to influencing the intensity of tropical cyclones and prolonging their lifetime. Not only do ocean heat content, large-scale weather patterns, and surface properties affect the amount of release of energy, but the modulation from aerosol particles on cloud properties is also present. With Hurricane Harvey (2017) fairly isolated over Texas, there was a unique opportunity to study the indirect impact of aerosols on the amount of record-breaking rainfall over the greater Houston area. Due to the non-linear processes involved in clouds microstructure, aerosol properties and the variability associated with the atmospheric environment, the quantification of the response of storms to aerosols is complex. To this end, we first reproduce Harvey using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a 3D-var assimilation framework that incorporates satellites, radio occultation, dropsondes, and surface measurements. We then study the aerosol indirect impacts using spectral bin microphysics in conjunction with aerosol properties simulated from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) model leveraging online aerosol microphysics with anthropogenic emissions (SP) and without ones (SC). In the vicinity of Harvey's landfall, the number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei at 1\% supersaturation using the anthropogenic emissions is found to be one order of magnitude (855 cm−3) larger than those simulated with only natural emissions (83 cm−3). We observed that a narrow plume of anthropogenic aerosols from western Texas was transported over the area at the moment when deep convection initiated, accelerating updrafts through releasing more latent heat, which in turn, resulted in an average enhancement of precipitation by 25 mm ({\textasciitilde} 8\%) over the greater Houston area. We observed a second peak at the right tail of the distribution of differences between experiments, which is an indication of the presence of more extreme rainfall over the area. As such, studies on the impact of aerosol emissions controls on exacerbating severe weather should be more encouraged.},

	abstract = {The primary focus of this study is to understand the contribution from excess moisture from crop transpiration to the severity of a heat wave episode that hit the Midwestern U.S. from 16 to 20 July 2011. To elucidate this, we first provide an optimal estimate of the transpiration water vapor flux using satellite total column water vapor retrievals whose accuracy and precision are characterized using independent observations. The posterior transpiration flux is estimated using a local ensemble transform Kalman filter that employs a mesoscale weather model as the forward model. The new estimation suggests that the prior values of transpiration flux from crops are biased high by 15\%. We further use the constrained flux to examine the sensitivity of meteorology to the contributions from crops. Over the agricultural areas during daytime, elevated moisture (up to 40\%) from crops not only increases humidity (thus the heat index) but also provides a positive radiative forcing by increasing downward longwave radiation (13 ± 4 W m−2) that results in even higher surface air temperature (+0.4 °C). Consequently, we find that the elevated moisture generally provides positive feedback to aggravate the heat wave, with daytime enhancements of heat index by as large as 3.3 ± 0.8 °C. Due to a strong diurnal cycle in the transpiration, the feedback tends to be stronger in the afternoon (up to 5 °C) and weaker at night. Results offer a potential basis for designing mitigation strategies for the effect of transpiration from agriculture in the future, in addition to improving the estimation of canopy transpiration.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Questions about how emissions are changing during the COVID-19 lockdown periods cannot be answered by observations of atmospheric trace gas concentrations alone, in part due to simultaneous changes in atmospheric transport, emissions, dynamics, photochemistry, and chemical feedback. A chemical transport model simulation benefiting from a multi-species inversion framework using well-characterized observations should differentiate those influences enabling to closely examine changes in emissions. This approach has another advantage in that we can, to a certain extent, disentangle the chemical and physical processes involved in the formation of ozone. Accordingly, we jointly constrain NO$_{\textrm{x}}$ and VOC emissions using well-characterized TROPOMI HCHO and NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ columns during the months of March, April, and May 2020 (lockdown) and 2019 (baseline). We observe a noticeable decline in the magnitude of NO$_{\textrm{x}}$ emissions in March 2020 (14\&ndash;31\&thinsp;\%) in several major cities including Paris, London, Madrid, and Milan expanding further to Rome, Brussels, Frankfurt, Warsaw, Belgrade, Kyiv, and Moscow (34\&ndash;51\&thinsp;\%) in April. The large variability of changes in NO$_{\textrm{x}}$ emissions is indicative of different dates and the degree of restrictions enacted to prevent the spread of the virus. For instance, NO$_{\textrm{x}}$ emissions remain at somewhat similar values or even higher in northern Germany and Moscow in March 2020 compared to the baseline. Comparisons against surface monitoring stations indicate that the model estimate of the NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ reduction is underestimated, a picture that correlates with the TROPOMI frequency impacted by cloudiness. During the month of April, when ample TROPOMI samples are present, the surface NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ reductions occurring in polluted areas are described fairly well by the model (model: \&minus;21\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;17\&thinsp;\%, observation: \&minus;29\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;21\&thinsp;\%). Changes in VOC emissions are dominated by eastern European biomass burning activities and biogenic isoprene emissions. In March, however, TROPOMI HCHO sets an upper limit for HCHO changes such that the chemical feedback of NO$_{\textrm{x}}$ on HCHO constrained by TROPOMI NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ reveals a non-negligible decline in anthropogenic VOC emissions in Paris (\&minus;9\&thinsp;\%), Milan (\&minus;29\&thinsp;\%), London (\&minus;5\&thinsp;\%), and Rome (\&minus;5\&thinsp;\%). Results support an increase in surface ozone during the lockdown. In April, the constrained model features a reasonable agreement with maximum daily 8\&thinsp;h average (MDA8) ozone changes observed at the surface (\textit{r}\&thinsp;=\&thinsp;0.43), specifically over central Europe where ozone enhancements prevail (model: +3.73\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;3.94\&thinsp;\%, +1.79\&thinsp;ppbv, observation: +7.35\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;11.27\&thinsp;\%, +3.76\&thinsp;ppbv). Results of integrated process rates of MDA8 surface ozone over central Europe in the same month suggest that physical processes (dry deposition, advection and diffusion) decrease ozone on average by \&minus;4.83\&thinsp;ppbv, while ozone production rates dampened by largely negative J$_{\textrm{NO2}}$[NO$_{\textrm{2}}$]-k$_{\textrm{NO+O3}}$[NO][O$_{\textrm{3}}$] become less negative, leading ozone to increase by +5.89\&thinsp;ppbv. Experiments involving fixed anthropogenic emissions suggest that meteorology (mainly as air temperature and photolysis) contributes to 42\&thinsp;\% enhancement in MDA8 surface ozone over the same region with the remaining part (58\&thinsp;\%) coming from changes in anthropogenic emissions. Results illustrate the capability of satellite data of major ozone precursors to help atmospheric models capture the essential character of ozone changes induced by abrupt emission anomalies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {To improve the representation of convective mixing of atmospheric pollutants in the presence of clouds, we developed a convection module based on Kain and Fritsch (KF) method and implemented it in the Community Multiscale Air Quality model. The KF-convection method is a mass-flux-based model that accounts for updraft flux, downdraft flux, entrainment, detrainment, and the subsidence effect. The method is consistent with the convection parametrization of the meteorology model. We apply the KF-convection model to an idealized case and to a reference setup prepared for East Asia during the KORUS-AQ campaign period to investigate its impact on carbon monoxide (CO) concentration at various atmospheric altitudes. We investigate the impact of KF-convection on the horizontal distribution of CO concentrations by comparing it to aircraft measurements and the MOPITT CO column. We further discuss two types of impacts of KF-convection: the direct impact caused by vertical movement of CO concentrations by updraft or downdraft and the indirect impact caused by transport of lifted CO concentrations to another region. May 12 saw a high indirect impact originating from the Shanghai region at higher altitudes and a high direct impact of updraft fluxes at 1 km altitude. However, May 26 revealed an immense updraft increasing higher altitude concentrations (up to 40 ppbv) and diverse indirect impacts over the region of the study (±50 ppbv). The overall comparison shows a strong connection between differences in the amount of concentration caused by the direct impact at each altitude with the presence of an updraft at that altitude. The developed model can be employed in large domains (i.e., East Asia, Europe, North America, and Northern Hemisphere) with sub-grid scale cloud modeling to include the impacts of convection.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Questions about how emissions are changing during the COVID-19 lockdown periods cannot be answered by observations of atmospheric trace gas concentrations alone, in part due to simultaneous changes in atmospheric transport, emissions, dynamics, photochemistry, and chemical feedback. A chemical transport model simulation benefiting from a multi-species inversion framework using well-characterized observations should differentiate those influences enabling to closely examine changes in emissions. Accordingly, we jointly constrain NO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{\textit{x}}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and VOC emissions using well-characterized TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO and NO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} columns during the months of March, April, and May 2020 (lockdown) and 2019 (baseline). We observe a noticeable decline in the magnitude of NO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{\textit{x}}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} emissions in March 2020 (14 \%–31 \%) in several major cities including Paris, London, Madrid, and Milan, expanding further to Rome, Brussels, Frankfurt, Warsaw, Belgrade, Kyiv, and Moscow (34 \%–51 \%) in April. However, NO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{\textit{x}}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} emissions remain at somewhat similar values or even higher in some portions of the UK, Poland, and Moscow in March 2020 compared to the baseline, possibly due to the timeline of restrictions. Comparisons against surface monitoring stations indicate that the constrained model underrepresents the reduction in surface NO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. This underrepresentation correlates with the TROPOMI frequency impacted by cloudiness. During the month of April, when ample TROPOMI samples are present, the surface NO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} reductions occurring in polluted areas are described fairly well by the model (model: {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}21 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 17 \%, observation: {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}29 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 21 \%). The observational constraint on VOC emissions is found to be generally weak except for lower latitudes. Results support an increase in surface ozone during the lockdown. In April, the constrained model features a reasonable agreement with maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) ozone changes observed at the surface ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{r}=0{\textless}/span{\textgreater}.43), specifically over central Europe where ozone enhancements prevail (model: {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}3.73 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 3.94 \%, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}1.79 ppbv, observation: {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}7.35 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 11.27 \%, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}3.76 ppbv). The model suggests that physical processes (dry deposition, advection, and diffusion) decrease MDA8 surface ozone in the same month on average by {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}4.83 ppbv, while ozone production rates dampened by largely negative {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M19" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}J{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow class="chem"{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}NO{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mn mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}2{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}{\textless}span{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="23pt" height="14pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="fb225b36f4647bbe458cf3624847db35"{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="acp-21-18227-2021-ie00001.svg" width="23pt" height="14pt" src="acp-21-18227-2021-ie00001.png"/{\textgreater}{\textless}/svg:svg{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}[NO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}]-{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M21" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}k{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow class="chem"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}NO{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}+{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}O{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mn mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}3{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}{\textless}span{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="35pt" height="14pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="38f7581ee295132097e596660c88727c"{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="acp-21-18227-2021-ie00002.svg" width="35pt" height="14pt" src="acp-21-18227-2021-ie00002.png"/{\textgreater}{\textless}/svg:svg{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}[NO][O{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}] become less negative, leading ozone to increase by {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}5.89 ppbv.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Most studies on validation of satellite trace gas retrievals or atmospheric chemical transport models assume that pointwise measurements, which roughly represent the element of space, should compare well with satellite (model) pixels (grid box). This assumption implies that the field of interest must possess a high degree of spatial homogeneity within the pixels (grid box), which may not hold true for species with short atmospheric lifetimes or in the proximity of plumes. Results of this assumption often lead to a perception of a nonphysical discrepancy between data, resulting from different spatial scales, potentially making the comparisons prone to overinterpretation. Semivariogram is a mathematical expression of spatial variability in discrete data. Modeling the semivariogram behavior permits carrying out spatial optimal linear prediction of a random process field using kriging. Kriging can extract the spatial information (variance) pertaining to a specific scale, which in turn translates pointwise data to a gridded space with quantified uncertainty such that a grid-to-grid comparison can be made. Here, using both theoretical and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that this classical geostatistical approach can be well adapted to solving problems in evaluating model-predicted or satellite-derived atmospheric trace gases. This study suggests that satellite validation procedures using the present method must take kriging variance and satellite spatial response functions into account.

Satellite-constrained nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions successfully improve model performance by significantly reducing the normalized mean bias of concentrations of NOx, Ozone (O3), and PM2.5 from most regions in China and South Korea. Anticyclones over the Yellow Sea transport air pollutants and increase the contribution of emissions from adjacent regions to local air quality. Fluxes of air pollutants with posterior emissions showed notable enhancements in their magnitude by 3\%–24\% for NOy, O3, and PM2.5. The contributions of emissions from neighboring regions on local NOx and O3 budgets in the planetary boundary layer were 22.96\%–35.24\% and 24.23\%–42.26\%. The contribution of emissions from North Korea was notable despite its comparably lower emission rates. Regarding the impact of external influences on local air quality, the enhanced chemical loss of NOx compensated for increases by transport. Also, the increased vertical gradient of maximum daily 8-hr average O3 amplified vertical transport and dry deposition processes in the opposite direction along with slight changes in the chemical net O3 production rate. This study shows the nonlinear response of local air quality to changes in the transport of air pollutants, which could be further investigated concerning changes in emissions and climatological factors that would modify the inflow of air pollutants.},
